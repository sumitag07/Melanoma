# Melanoma CNN model
In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in tensorflow.

## Dataset:
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases

## Target Column:
we will be classifying images into:
Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion


## Conclusions
Model Building & training : Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
Trained the model for ~20 epochs on CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
The model overfits.
Rectified class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library. Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data:
Created a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
Using optimiser and loss function for model training
Train the model for ~30 epochs
